# NVD-Crawler

I developed a microservice project designed to automate the extraction of vulnerabilities from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) website. This essential tool streamlines the process of identifying security flaws in various software packages and applications. Key highlights of the project include:

  -  Crawling Capability: The microservice is equipped with a robust web crawling mechanism, enabling it to traverse the NVD website efficiently.
  -  Data Extraction: It extracts comprehensive information about vulnerabilities, including their descriptions, severity ratings, affected software versions, and mitigation strategies.
  -  Data Storage: The project integrates a data storage solution, allowing for the organized storage and retrieval of vulnerability data for further analysis and reporting.
  - API Integration: It provides a RESTful API interface, enabling seamless integration with other applications and systems for real-time vulnerability data access.
